Below are some long outstanding features I'm currently waiting for across my software stack. If I wrote this post a few weeks ago, it would have felt very bleak with no `In Progress` to be seen. There is a glimmer of hope, so I'm going to embrace it and hope there is more coming soon.

- 1Password supports alternate browsers (Orion) - `In Progress`

- Bear 2 - `In Progress... Forever?`

- Lightroom iOS - Support for groups
- Lightroom iOS - HDR, Panorama Merge
- Photoshop iOS - Specify crop dimensions, move image during crop
