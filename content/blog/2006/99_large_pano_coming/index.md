When we were home last weekend (in the great weather), I went out to the hill by my house to take a pano of Mt. Diablo. I thought I'd try to push it, and right now my computer is crunching on a 250 MP image! I started on my laptop (which is faster) for 12 hours, but it only got around 30% done. I didn't want to tie up my laptop that long, so I kicked off the process again on my desktop (only 500Mhz and 612 MB memory) so it might take a long time, but the initial output looks pretty good. I'll post (albiet a much smaller version) when its done.

<em>Update</em>

Going on 36 hours and about 50% done...

<em>Update<sup>2</sup></em>

60 hours and about 80% done... My poor desktop has been trashing like none other. Blending operations requiring more than <strong>4GB</strong> to accomplish!! This was an 84 stitch pano! 250 Mega Pixels! The guy who wrote the software was the first to put together a 1 GP (gigapixel) pano! Some serious stuff.
