My little contribution to the <a title="Canvas for Wordpress" href="https://www.freshpursuits.com/canvas/">Canvas</a> community. This plugin uses the Del.icio.us javascript link roll interface to display your del.icio.us links as a block in Canvas.

<h4>Download</h4>

<strong>Updated 6.30.06</strong>

Download it here: <a title="Delicious v1" href="https://blog.mcstudios.net/delicious_v1.zip">delicious_v1.zip</a>

<h4>Installation</h4>

Simply unzip the two files into your <em>wp-content/plugins/Canvas/plugins</em> directory, and then go to <em>Block Management </em>and rescan. The block is filed under Services. Click on the block properties to set your login, and customize its appearance. I've wrapped the javascript call in a div class="delicious" to give you a bit more control over how its displayed in your blog.

Add your questions/comments & feedback to this post (or in the Canvas forums).
