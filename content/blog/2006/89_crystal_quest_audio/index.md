Remember! These are from a game released in 1989 on a platform released in 1986. We are talking the infancy of personal desktop computing here. These are ogg files from the actual game. I only got a handful of sounds. I know there are some cooler stuff at later levels. Be sure to at least check out the last one!

**Crystal's and Enemy**

<audio controls><source src="crystal_and_enemy.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/></audio>

**You Died**

<audio controls><source src="died.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/></audio>

**Special**

<audio controls><source src="special.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/></audio>

**Whee!**

<audio controls><source src="whee.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/></audio>

**Orgasmic**

<audio controls><source src="orgasmic.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/></audio>

When you think about it, the Apple IIgs was <em>way</em> ahead of its time!
