Thanks to a Firefox extension known as <a title="Sage" href="https://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage</a>, I have discovered RSS feeds. I never really understood why it was such a big deal. I had never seen a good implementation of a reader that made it clear. Well I do know. I went out and pulled all the RSS feeds for the sites I frequent, and Sage provides a wonderful interface for reading and catching up with the world. The great feature is that when you are on a site you like, you can have it look through for any feeds for it automatically, every handy, as most people try to hide the RSS link. Having an RSS reader as part of the browser just makes natural sense to me.

Fundamentally, I'm sold. Now I just need the ability to sync my feeds with all the computers I'm on automatically =)
