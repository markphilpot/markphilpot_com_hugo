I believe I have officially retired my desktop. My trusty (and severely abused) desktop put together in <strike>1998</strike> 1999 (thanks Jeff) has served faithfully. However its 500 MHz processor and slow hard drives finally did it in. Right now I do most of my computing on my laptop, for the simple fact it really is much faster. I tried installing Linux (Kubuntu) on it, but my motherboard (Abit BE6) has a "exotic" UDMA controller by Highpoint, that doesn't seem to work well. I can only get ATA/33 rather than the full ATA/66, so right now its relegated to powered off (the apartment is definitely a lot quieter with it off).

I think I'm still going to hold off getting a new one till when we move back to CA (I don't want to put another desktop through a cross country move). I'm not sure if I want to start gutting it (get some external housing for the harddrives). I still need the monitor because it is actually calibrated for my digital imaging/photoshop work. I guess for the near future it will just sit there. I don't have a closet here that I can stick it and have it serve as a NAS (and it makes too much noise to have it on and not really doing anything).
