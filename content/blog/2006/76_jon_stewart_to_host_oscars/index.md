<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/05/film.oscars.reut/index.html">CNN.com - Jon Stewart set to host Oscars - Jan 5, 2006</a>

Oh this is going to be good! As long as the network lets him have fun, there should be loads of fun for the rest of us. At least it will be an Oscars worth watching.

Speaking of Oscars... We saw <a title="Kong" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360717/">King Kong</a> earlier this week, and I was debating with myself should <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/">Jackson</a> be eligible for an Oscar? I'd have to do more research than I can right now, but I believe the Oscars weren't around in <a title="The Original" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/">1933</a>.

The movie by the way, is definitely worth seeing on a big screen. I'll post more later... gotta run tackle some PRs.
