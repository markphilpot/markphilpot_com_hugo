So I decided to take a peek at the stats they my webhost keeps about my domain. Lots of interesting things I never new (all numbers are rounded down to a nice even number).

<ul>
	<li>Between January 2005 and January 2006, my domain (everything under mcstudios.net) had 51,000 visits</li>
	<li>During that year, I served <strong>12.5</strong> <strong>GB</strong> of data (about a GB a month)</li>
	<li>During the month of November (the month of most traffic) I had 190 visits per day.</li>
</ul>
I also have a breakdown of what type of browser visited the site.  From the (top) User Agent strings, the breakdown looks like
<ul>
	<li>50% Internet Explorer</li>
	<li>12% Mozilla</li>
	<li>17% Bots (Google, MSN, Yahoo)</li>
	<li>1% Safari</li>
	<li>20% Other (It only listed the top user agent strings.  Most of Other is probably IE)</li>
</ul>
The software package my host uses to keep track of these things doesn't look very good.  I could probably roll my own or go find a PHP script or PHP Pear implementation to integrate, but really I'm lazy =)

It looks like most of my traffic is through the <a title="www.duke.edu/web/DUMB" href="https://dumb.mcstudios.net">Band website</a> (figures), but actually not as much as I might have thought. It will be interesting to look at the stats next spring and see if Mozilla/Firefox gains even more ground.
