<a title="Dreamfall" href="https://www.dreamfall.com">Dreamfall</a> is the highly anticipated sequel to <a title="TLJ" href="https://www.longestjourney.com/">The Longest Journey</a>, which in my opinion was one of the best true adventure games to come along since Sierra Online was in its heyday. The <a title="Trailer" style="cursor: url('chrome://targetalert/content/skin/movie.png')" href="ftp://ftp.funcom.com/media/Dreamfall/final_dreamfall_trailer_funcom_qtmp4.mov">trailer</a> looks to keep true to the spirit. You won't see mind blowing video sequences. In fact it looks like they took standard game play for most of it (we'll see when it arrives this spring). The biggest achievement of TLJ was the characters and story, and this one doesn't look to disappoint. TLJ seemed to be received as a national accomplishment of Norway, whose government gave it investment money to promote the achievements of Norway (which is pretty cool when you think about it). I haven't played many games (on the PC) in a very long time.

Over Christmas I got a PS2, primarily for playing the Final Fantasy series as well as the Prince of Persia series. I haven't upgraded my desktop in years (its the one I built senior year of high school and its still cranking away). Though at this point, I do most of my computing on my laptop, which isn't that suited for hardcore gaming. Anyway, I'm not sure what the point of that was, other than this is a game I'm actually looking forward to.
