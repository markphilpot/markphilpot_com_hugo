<a title="Wine Is Not an Emulator" href="https://www.winehq.com/">Wine</a> is the open source Windows emulator program for Linux -- A very handy thing to have working well if you ever want to make the transition. I have already determined that when I put together my next desktop which will hopefully be some time next year, I will run Kubuntu (If any of this sounds familiar, I already blogged about it =) <a title="For Linux... They also have a OSX version" href="https://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/">Cossover Office</a> is a program put out by <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/">Codeweavers</a> that is based on Wine. What it adds is the configuration management that IMO is almost impossible without. A perfect example of making a business off of open source software.

I'm trying to capture what I need to work with Crossover. Figure out what works now, and what hopefully will come soon.

<li>Capture One LE</li>
<li>PT Assembler + tools</li>
<li>Quicken</li>

    <li>Advertised to work but not tested</li>

    <li>Currently houses my movie and CD collection. However, I think I'll eventually migrate over to <a href="https://www.periapsis.org/tellico/">Tellico</a> (KDE app) when it gets to v2.0</li>
</ul>
<li>Photoshop CS</li>

Things that if they worked, would be great, but probably are not deal breakers (I will continue running XP on my laptop since IBM/Lenovo doesn't (yet) include the integration software and drivers for linux.

<ul>
    <li>Drumsite</li>
    <li>Finale 2002</li>
    <li>Guitar Pro</li>
    <li>Cubase</li>
</ul>

My testing rig is my old desktop (which is frighteningly slow at this point). I'll post updates as things work or don't work.
