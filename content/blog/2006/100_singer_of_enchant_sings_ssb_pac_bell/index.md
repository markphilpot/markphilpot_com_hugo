So, granted this was a while ago (last summer), but they finally got the <a title="Ted of Enchant sings SSB" style="cursor: url('chrome://targetalert/content/skin/movie.png')" href="https://www.theoasis.cc/pictures/ted_ssb_live.mpg">video up</a>. <a title="Enchant" href="https://www.theoasis.cc/">Enchant</a> is a really cool Bay Area progressive rock band. I've run into them a few times at <a title="DT" href="https://www.dreamtheater.net">Dream Theater</a> concerts. If anyone is interested I can send them a few files (of course, at this point no one trusts me to even give it a chance =) Oh well. Check out the video. I think he did a great job.

There are a bunch of bands that I haven't been keeping up with (suddenly realized I never picked up Enchants last studio album, which was back in 2003!) I guess that's the realities of job life.
