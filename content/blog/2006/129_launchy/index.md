So I stumbled upon <a href="https://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> today. The documentation is fairly poor, but it's a launcher for OSX. The fundamental idea is that you press a hotkey combination and start typing the name of the program as soon as it finds a match, you press enter and it runs. I was skeptical, but people rave about it. So I thought... OK is there a windows equivalent?Well there is a great open source equivalent -- <a href="https://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a>. Small download, small resource usage and it fits the bill perfectly. Download and try it. I don't think you will be disappointed. It is much better than trying to navigate the Start Menu with a mouse (especially on a laptop). You'll soon find it is indispensable (and I've just been using it for a few hours!)
