Unfortunately it looks like Ann tore her ACL skiing a week ago Sunday. She visits an orthopedic specialist tomorrow (well technically today, given its 12:30pm here), and hopefully we'll be able to find out exactly how bad it is (though probably a followup for an MRI will be needed). Anyway, she looks to be out of commission for quite a while. She probably wouldn't like me posting this, but I have a feeling if you happened to call to catch up, she'd appreciate it (try not to let it slip that you know ahead of time, or you'll give me away).
