Ann and I saw him in concert at the Warner Theater last night, where he was taping for an HBO special. Just the right about of indignation, rage, equal-opportunity offender for an absolutely fantastic night of comedy =) I think the HBO special is coming out in June (I don't recall the exact date). The tour is called "Red, White & Screwed."" He's actually appearing at Oakland's Paramount Theater on May 6th... I'd definitely check it out if you have a chance.
