I think this is how I feel every time I try to get ramped up to start/restart/begin/continue blogging. It always starts with noble intentions.

This first post will be where I experiment with pelican's capabilities and how best to use markdown.

The code block below has no line numbers[ref]This is a footnote[/ref]

    :::bash
    function k
    {
        level=$1
        cdback=""
        for i in `seq 1 $level`
        do
            cdback=$cdback"../"
        done

        cd $cdback
    }

where as this one does

    #!bash
    function k
    {
        level=$1
        cdback=""
        for i in `seq 1 $level`
        do
            cdback=$cdback"../"
        done

        cd $cdback
    }

Back ticks allow you to `highlight` section.
