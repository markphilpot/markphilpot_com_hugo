![Dence](banners/dence.jpg "ew1920")

> Many years have passed since humanity was driven to the brink of extinction by the sudden emergence of the unknown life forms Gadoll. Those humans that survived now dwell in a 3000 meter-high mobile fortress Deca-dence built to protect themselves from the Gadoll threat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Denizens of Deca-dence fall into two categories: Gears, warriors who fight the Gadoll daily, and Tankers, those without the skills to fight. One day, Natsume, a Tanker girl who dreams of becoming a Gear meets surly Kaburagi, an armor repairman of Deca-dence.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This chance meeting between the seemingly two opposites, the girl with a positive attitude who never gives up on her dreams and the realist who has given up on his, will eventually shake the future course of this world.

But there&#x27;s more going on than meets the eye, and Tiara learns the alarming truth about her admittance: all four members of her group are failing, and if they don&#x27;t pass this semester, all of them will be expelled as a group – including their newest member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
