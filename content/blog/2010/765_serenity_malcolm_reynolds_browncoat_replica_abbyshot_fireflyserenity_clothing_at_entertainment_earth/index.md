Squeee! <a href='https://www.entertainmentearth.com/prodinfo.asp?number=ABROWNCOAT%20SMALL'>Serenity Malcolm Reynolds Browncoat Replica</a>. Awesome!

Unfortunately the price is quite steep ($320), but just think of how many Halloweens this would cover where you didn't have to stress out about what the hell you'll wear to that party! Here's what you need to complete the costume:

<ul>
	<li>Pants [<a href="https://www.wwmerc.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=CM83&type=store">link</a>] $40</li>
	<li>Suspenders</li>
	<li>Boots [<a href="https://www.motorcowboy.com/product/CAPT1">link</a>] $450 (but I'm sure you can find cheaper)</li>
	<li>Holster</li>
	<li>Red Shirt</li>
	<li>Replica Gun</li>
</ul>

Worth it?
