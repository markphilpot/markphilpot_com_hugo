King's Quest VI was one of my first "obsession" games. I first played it at Matt's house who had x386 with enough memory to run it. I can't remember what sound card he had (either a SoundBlaster 16 or Pro Audio Spectrum), but it was something with emulated Roland MT-32 MIDI and even then, the music of this game was absolutely awesome.

Decades past... <a href="https://www.queststudios.com/">Quest Studios</a> released both MIDI and digital versions of the music from many of the popular Sierra games. I wanted to put my new Roland JV-1080 through it's paces, and since Quest Studios only had a Fantom XR rendition, I thought I would construct my own. Definitely check out Quest Studios for other sounds tracks from classic Sierra games!

_Update_ -- Quest Studios has been moved to [The Quest Studios Archive](https://www.midimusicadventures.com/queststudios). The new home for the KQ6 OST is [here](https://www.midimusicadventures.com/queststudios/digital-soundtracks/kq6/).
