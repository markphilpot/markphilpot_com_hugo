[A Wizard of Mars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1583121.A_Wizard_of_Mars) by [Diane Duane](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11761.Diane_Duane)

Diane Duane has done it again. An incredibly well crafted story in the universe she has crafted and evolved over nine fantastic books. For any fan of the series, this is a must read. Anyone new, I highly recommend starting from the first installment.

The painstaking descriptions of the Mars environment really makes everything real - as if this could really be happening and we are oblivious to it. The plot development is a bit like A Wizard's Dilemma and A Wizard Alone where Kit and Nita are separated for much of the book. I happen to like the stories where they are together a bit more, but I felt the separation was well done and not as forced or contrived as it was in the earlier two books.

Bottom line: I loved it. Duane's series continues to be one of my all time favorites!
