I'm basically swamped at the moment. Graduation is this weekend and I have to pack up my room at the same time. I will then be driving to DC and then to the Bay Area next week, so I'll definitely be incognito for at least a couple of weeks. But I'll try to be right back up to post some of the interesting travel exploits.

It would be need to have a cellular internet connection to do things while I'm driving cross country, but oh well =)

Until then...
