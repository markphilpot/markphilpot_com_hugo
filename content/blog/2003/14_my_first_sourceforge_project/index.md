The web project I did for the Marching Band... we'll I'm turning that into an open source project. =) I know everyone is going "Huh? And why is this a big deal?" Well it is =)

In case your interested, you can head on over to https://sourceforge.net/projects/orgonline/ and check it out. I've CVSed the initial repository. Any volunteers? Oh well =)
