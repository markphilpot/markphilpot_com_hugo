I'm heading to DC on Monday, and will be back on Thursday. Everyone wish me luck =) I haven't heard from any other companies yet, so this might be one of my few chances to get a job.

Ann and I have been planning our moving trip to DC, and have been disgusted with the U-Haul prices for out-of-town moves. Its nuts! But we've finally managed to find a work around that will allow us to get most of the stuff we want to bring out there. I don't know how people do lots of major moves (Ann's done an incredible amount in her lifetime).

I'll check back soon. I haven't had much time to tweak the website. I really want to get the CD portion done so I can enter that information soon... but the summer seems likes its fleeting already (and its only June!).

Ok, taking off to the bars...
