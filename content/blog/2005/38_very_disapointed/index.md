I was planning on buying a new laptop this summer. I was going with a IBM Thinkpad, because I wanted to finally get one before Lenovo completely took over production. To sweeten the deal, I get an IBM discount through Lockheed. I had picked out the model I wanted, and I was waiting for it to drop about $100 more dollars before I was going to get it.

I discover today that the settlement between IBM and Lenovo was finally inked today, and now its officially not an IBM Thinkpad (though Lenovo is going to keep using the name for the next five years), but even worse, I don't get my nice corporate discount any more! Grrr.

I really like the model I was going to get, so I may try to snag it when it becomes cheaper... but damn my luck.
