Does anyone else's head hurt listening to him?? (The one who decided to give a speech in primetime this evening).

It is amazing how much he talks and how little he says. His energy bill is a joke... I didn't need Ann to tell me, but all the things Ann brings home... its fucking scary!!

As Ann just said, "And we thought OJ Simpson got away with murder..." Lets reduce our dependance on <em>foreign oil</em> by increasing the supply of domestic oil, instead of reducing our demand! <em>AAARRGGG.</em>

I don't know enough about economics to know what to think of his Social Security policy. I don't feel so bad, because I don't think the experts or doctorates know either. I think the SS assets could be earning a higher return than they are now, but I don't think Bush's policy is the way to go...
