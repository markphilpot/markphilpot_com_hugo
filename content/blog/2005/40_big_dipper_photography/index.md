Well, I tried to do another session of astrophotography last night. I can see a handful of the brightest stars, but its really an uninteresting picture (just a bunch of dots). Obviously, a telescope would be handy, but even with the help there is probably just too much light pollution. Also, the lack of any good documentation on Registax is actually quite frustrating. Its a very powerful program, its just hard to control, especially how sluggish it performs on my machine (I'm sure if I had anything resembling a modern machine, it would do a lot better). I also don't think it helps that I'm trying to do this type of photography on a crappy tripod from Wal-Mart (can't afford a good setup, which is surprisingly expensive). Oh well.
