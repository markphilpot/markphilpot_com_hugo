I hope to get the Photography Resource on the main site written in the next few weeks. I've especially been working on Pano photography. I've discovered quite a few resources that I've found extremely useful. However, for some unknown reason I've had a bitch of a time getting FTP access to my host. It keeps dropping out, and then locking me out, saying I've reach maximum connections for my host. Hopefully they can resolve it soon. I've notified support, but just going on a description, I'm not sure how much they'll be able to help.

I'm not going to loose hope yet, but with about 5 days to the new moon, the light pollution is hiding all but the brightest starts. Given that I'm in the middle of a city, I guess I can't expect much. I'm still going to try. If anything good results, I'll go ahead and post it.
