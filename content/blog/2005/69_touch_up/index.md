I touched up the site's CSS. The background is now fixed, having discovered that finally fixed the bug that causes the CPU to go to 100% when scrolling against a fixed attachment background. I need to update my CD & DVD collections... the DVD collection won't be hard, but I'm in the process of moving my CD collection to a different storage format. Problem is that it requires me to redo it from scratch. The plus is that I get most of the CD covers automatically from Amazon. I think that will take a while.

I have been working on a complete PHP update for the Duke Marching Band site. The original was done in JSP, which while powerful, doesn't lend itself to a third party host, where you don't have control over the server reboots. The PHP port is about 80% complete, and I will probably upload it mid December.
