It has been a long while since I have been really sick... Needless to say... oh it sucks. Sick on the couch all weekend, and still not better come Monday... arg.

Duke Basketball starts today... Game 1 of the preseason NIT tournament on ESPN2. This should be a great year! Solid senior player of the year candidates and extremely talented freshmen... should be lots of fun.

<a href="https://jeff.specular.org">Jeff's site</a> has a nice redesign. Getting a new CSS design takes a shit load of work, time and patience. Kudos.
