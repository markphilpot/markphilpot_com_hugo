I have now determined I know nothing of the way Hollywood marketing works. Take the following... Do you remember <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208003/">Big Momma's House</a>? Before you <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208003/business">click the link</a>... guess how much it made gross US... (I'll give you a hint... its budget was approximately $30 million and it made $25 million on its opening weekend)...

They are now making a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421729/">sequel</a>! WTF! How the hell does that work? Maybe that's just the economics of having a big star. But I mean, come on! It got <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_mommas_house/">absymal </a>reviews! And yet people went and saw it and it definitely tripped the "Oh we can definitely make profit on this one! Turn out more shit!"

I guess I should just stop second guessing. Ann and I should make it to a showing of Harry Potter today. Should be good.
