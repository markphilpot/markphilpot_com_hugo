Shaved off.

In case you are wondering I'm referring to my goatee that I had for about 6 months now. I already new that I would shave it off for the wedding. However, I must say (and Ann agrees with me) that I look about 5 years younger without it. While that will be a good thing at some point in the future, I like the look and so does Ann =)

So, I think the conclusion is that it will be back after the wedding (unless anyone can convince me otherwise).
