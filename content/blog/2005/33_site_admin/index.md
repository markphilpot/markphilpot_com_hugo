So I actually have been doing a bunch of work on the site. The main area hasn't been updated because the menu system I use (<a href="https://www.likno.com">allwebmenus</a>) hasn't responded to my email about a link to their v3 software (which I paid for). They only have v4, which I haven't (and didn't want to) upgrade to. Personally, I think it is incredibly disingenuous. Hopefully they get back to me soon and don't try to stiff me.
