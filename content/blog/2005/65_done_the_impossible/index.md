This is why I love <em>Firefly</em>. This a fan-oreinted, fan-made documentary about <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Serenity</em>. It is focused on the fan base and contains interviews from the cast, crew and Joss (even Orson Scott Card, writer of the great novel "Ender's Game"). There are two clips available now... definitely check them out. Its very professional looking, and the fans making it are donating a percentage to Joss's favorite charity.

Even with all my rants, if you haven't seen the pilot of <em>Firefly</em>, at least go to blockbuster and rent the first disc (even better, go out and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AQS0F/103-3482693-3975003?v=glance&n=130&n=507846&s=dvd&v=glance">buy it</a> (its only $27! A great deal).
