I'm really excited... there are a bunch of movies coming out in the next two months that look really good!

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0294870/">Rent</a> - I was a huge fan of the Broadway Production. I love the music, and I love the characters. From all the buzz, it seems like they treated it well.

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330373/">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a> - By far my favorite book of the series thus far. Very dark, very interesting plot (and twists). I am not at all familiar with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001565/">Mike Newell's</a> work, but from the previews, it looks grand and impressive. I do like how they are getting a new director for each film. It keeps it fresh with a new perspective every time.

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360717/">King Kong</a> - This looks really cool. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/">Peter Jackson</a> is coming off an incredible high point with the LotR films. This doesn't look to disappoint.

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363771/">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a> - I'm praying that Disney hasn't ruined this. Fantastic children's story (I read all of C.S. Lewis before I got to Tolkien). I'm not sure I like Disney's hand in this (what/when was the last thing they had a hand in that was good?), but it should be good based on the material they were working with.

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/">Syriana</a> - I still haven't seen <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433383/">Clooney's last one</a>, but this has received excellent press (and my wife also happens to be involved in some of the promotion events =)
