Some cool things I've stumbled upon lately

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.text-image.com/">Text Image</a> - Converts images to use colored text.  Really neat output actually.  Very impressed by a simple web application.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.panoramas.dk.nyud.net:8090/index.html">Panoramas.dk</a> - Really cool panoramas and VR.  They have really cool "exhibits"... war in Iraq, Moon Landing, etc.  Most require a latest version of Quicktime, but definitely worth checking out.</li>
	<li><a href="https://taint.org/xplanet/">Nearly-Live Planetary Desktop Backgrounds</a> - I've set this up as my rotating background! Using the open source xplanet software, it generates images for download about once an hour.  You can set it up so it rotates on your desktop... almost like a nice weather forecast!</li>
</ul>
