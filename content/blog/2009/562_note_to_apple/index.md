Please give us a mouse with <strong>two freaking buttons</strong>! This right-click success rate of 50% is annoying the crap out of me. I pulled out my old crappy Belkin travel mouse and you know what? When I want to right click now? I just press <em>the right mouse button</em> and what do you know?! It works <strong>every freaking time!</strong> I know design means a lot to you -- so go ahead and design a great "actual" two button mouse. Thankyouverymuchokby.
