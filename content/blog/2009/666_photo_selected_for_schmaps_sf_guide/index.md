One of my panoramas of the Golden Gate Bridge has been <a href="https://www.schmap.com/sanfrancisco/entertainment_thepresidio/#r=none&mapview=Map&tab=Places&p=26630&topleft=37.83616,-122.48666&bottomright=37.76128,-122.43842&i=26630_262.jpg">included</a> in the latest edition of Schmap's SF <a href="https://www.schmap.com/sanfrancisco/home/">guide</a>.
