I've been enjoying Delain's new album "April Rain" via imeem.com. I saw the video for the single "April Rain" a while ago, but never followed up. Female fronted rock and metal bands are really starting to pick up in Europe (Delain is a Dutch band). I hope some of that will eventually translate to new US bands.
