My first iPhone web application: iSuperGP. If you use supergenpass.com for your password management, iSuperGP helps you use it on your iPhone. Using HTML5 local storage, you can save your sites locally so you don't have to retype them every time in the SGP mobile version. The application is fully offline enabled, so you can bookmark it as an application and access your passwords even when you're disconnected. If you find anything wrong or have suggestions, the support site is @ <a href="https://www.isupergp.com/trac">here</a>

The app is built using the <a href="https://www.jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a> jQuery framework for mobile web development. It still has a few quirks, but it's fairly spectacular at imitating native iPhone applications. Also, it's extremely frustrating trying to develop an iPhone web application when the only place to reliably test is on iPhone Safari browser itself. I don't have a Mac yet, so I'm not able to use the XCode simulator.
