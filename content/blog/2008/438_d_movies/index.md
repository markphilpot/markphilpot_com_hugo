Nikon's new D90 comes with Video! At first I was skeptical... but <a href="https://chsvimg.nikon.com/products/imaging/lineup/d90/en/d-movie/">check out this video</a>!! The incredible thing is that you have a kick ass lens in front with a very high quality sensor, and it's a amazing what the results look like! The control over depth of field is simply amazing! I was going to save up for Nikon's new full frame <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/previews/nikond700/">D700</a>, but this will give me pause to consider the possibilities of the D90...
