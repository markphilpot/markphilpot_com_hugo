While skiing was a week too early (the big storm is just hitting now), it was fun to actually ski after a two year hiatus. Really needed about 6-12 more inches to actually get complete coverage -- we'll get that and much more this weekend. I've decided to go with a flickr account for my photo album. I've been seduced by its user interface (and most of the other perks, even though its an extra $2 a month for it). What this hopefully means is that things will be a bit more active around here.

I probably won't be removing my existing gallery for a bit (at least until I can get a critical mass up).
