Currently a television kick...

If you haven't seen the first two Terminator episodes... <a href="https://www.fox.com">go now</a>! I'm so sad the writer's strike is on! I want a full season damn it! Summer Glau is awesome and steels the entire show! She really is amazingly well cast for this role. I think they have the flexibility to develop some really great plots...

I finished watching all of Farscape. Spectacular show if you can get by some of the initial hokiness. Its a series that needed one more season (even with a mini-series ending) to truly wrap up everything. Simone, I think you'd really like it.

I started watching the first few episodes of Dr. Who. So totally British, I love it. True to the Dr. Who franchise -- if you've never seen any of them, it may take you a bit to adjust to things... Think a little like a BBC version of Quantum Leap, but much much better.

Anyway, more later.
