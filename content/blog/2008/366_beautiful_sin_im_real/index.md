I still have the CD backordered, but there may be print issues, so who knows. Thanks to <a href="https://www.imeem.com">imeem</a>, you can checkout my favorite song from it so far. You don't get many groups with a female vocalist this powerful and raw (almost Janis Joplin-esque).

Additionally, I'm becoming a huge fan of imeem. I don't use it as a social networking site (facebook/twitter/blog is quite enough for me to handle at the moment), but it is a legitimate way to embed songs like this.
