My second music video (this time in the true spirit of AMV) using scenes from Final Fantasy X set to The Urge's It's My Turn To Fly from Titan A.E.

The lyrics are actually quite appropriate for FFX. Ironically, this was (while much quicker to do) harder to piece together. I was less intimately familiar with the video material and it was a much shorter song. I think it turned out pretty well. Let me know what you think.
