I'm going to post a follow up later this weekend... As soon as you can, go buy/rent/borrow the first season of Jericho, and then go to cbs.com and watch the first 4 (of 7) episodes for season 2.

It was already cancelled once, and the fans managed to get CBS to buy 7 episodes for this season... nothing is yet confirmed on it's future. CBS doesn't have nearly as many "shows" as Fox or ABC... And given they don't spend nearly enough promoting the show, the only thing to be done is do it by word of mouth.

This is a fantastic show with superb acting and story line! I'll have more details tomorrow.
