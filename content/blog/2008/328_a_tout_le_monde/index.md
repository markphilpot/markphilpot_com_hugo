Thanks to some Guitar Hero time over the holidays, I've found some good songs from Megadeth that I really like. The obvious ones being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZmPD6-vNVY&feature=related">Symphony of Destruction</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqdFnbHAlw&feature=related">Hanger 18</a>, but I discovered that they re-released their controversial song A Tout Le Monde, remixed and added vocals from the singer of Lacuna Coil, Christina Scabbia. The original is a great song, but I actually like the re-release better. Definitely give it a listen!
