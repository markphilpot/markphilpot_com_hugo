Trying to take advantage of a spectacular day (Saturday) we decided to leave our confines (Palo Alto) and head north (San Francisco). While it was a great day, it was incredibly hazy which intruded on some quality photography time. All my shots of the Gate were overblown (no thanks to the fact that there is a high green hedge around the Coit Tower circle that acts as a black sink for the camera's meter). Oh well.

After the hike up and back we circled around to Union Square for a bit of shopping and finished with dinner at Oola.
