There are a lot more fully informed opinions on Apple iPhone SDK announcement, but here are a few of my thoughts as to how it relates to my own personal world...

<ul>
	<li>Apple struck a good compromise on control versus freedom.  I think most people are happy with the benefits and willing to accept the limitations.</li>
	<li>I have never tried the Apple Xcode development platform... I might have to spring for a mac mini =)</li>
	<li>No 3G or GPS announcement.  I think 3G is eminent, but I'm skeptical on whether they will ever integrate GPS.</li>
	<li>With the added enterprise features, RIM has every reason to quake in their boots.  With a simple firmware update, Apple has swallowed RIM's business turf.  The only thing that is left is the hardware keyboard versus the touch screen keyboard.</li>
</ul>

I think I'm going to at least wait until June to see some of the stuff the SDK can do, and hopefully Apple will release a hardware refresh with 3G in June as well. In any case, I don't think it makes sense at this point to jump on gen1 hardware.
