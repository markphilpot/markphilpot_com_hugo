I've been less active blogging and more engaged in other social media outlets (twitter, friendfeed, etc). My Friendfeed <a href="https://friendfeed.com/mphilpot?format=atom">RSS</a> is probably the best way to keep track of everything if you use feeds, or check <a href="https://blog.mcstudios.net/my-feed">this</a> page. If you don't use friendfeed and are into that sort of thing (ie have multiple avenues via which you engage the internet), I highly recommend trying it out.

Just got back from an East Coast trip to DC and Boston, and I'm completely exhausted. I inevitably always need a vacation from the vacationing. I have lots of pictures pending, so stay tuned.
