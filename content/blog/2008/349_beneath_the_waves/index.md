The new single from Ayreon's new album 01011001. Fantastic ensemble cast... He always puts together great singers with some great performances and catchy harmonies.

The video is pretty abstract, but seems to fit well with the song. I received the album yesterday, and will listen to the two discs this week to and from work. There is just no one else doing anything that sounds like this.
