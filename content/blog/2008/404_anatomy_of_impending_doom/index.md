Evolution of a doomed conversation...

<ul>
	<li>Oh, the demo... its a quick informal thing... think of it as an opportunity to show off your prototype work.  Just show what you have...</li>
	<li>Oh, its now a formal demo... handful of customer reps... no big deal</li>
	<li>Oh, its just three demos...  And by the way, how much extra functionality can you add in 7 business days?</li>
	<li>You know that feature your schedule says will take another 3 months to complete... can we have a prototype of that prototype for the demo?</li>
</ul>

Don't you just love things presented to you as an "opportunity"? It's a very, very scary word =) They often are "good" but the devil is in the details... Still, "opportunities" are much better than "risks"
