Damn it! Why is everyone so against pets in the housing and rental markets (especially the latter). Yes, I know, I know... If you were a landlord you wouldn't exactly want pets around because the might damage something or be a sound annoyance... but damn it! There has to be people out there who make apartment buildings or condos that are pet friendly.

Ann and I have wanted a dog since we graduated. Our building in DC didn't allow them and when we starting looking for an actual house, that was one of the primary reasons for it.

Again, here we are in California wishing we could have a dog... We're starting again to look for something that will accommodate pets (as well as being simply larger), but having that criteria drastically reduces your options... That just really sucks.
