Why is it hard trying to keep a habit of writing a bit every day. Seriously, you think this would be a bit easier... Lots of people do it now.

I must confess, its been a lot harder to keep motivated to get things done (GTD) in the hobby sense when I get home from work... Quite a few things are contributing factors:

<ul>
	<li>Conserving Power -- I no longer keep my desktop powered 24x7 since we moved into our new place.  It's just enough inertia to actually have an effect.  Sure I use my laptop, but it doesn't have the same horse power for the heavy lifting tasks.</li>
	<li>Longer Work Hours -- Not significantly longer, but again, just enough to add up</li>
	<li>Desktop Location -- The desktop is upstairs in the office.  Especially during the summer, it was way too hot to spend extended periods of time up there.  I need to reconsider having my guitar up ther as well, as I don't get around to playing it as often as I'd like.</li>
	<li>Wolfi -- First thing I do when I get home is run around with him, take him for a walk and feed him.  Don't get me wrong -- I love it!  But its a few hours tacked on to the end of the day.</li>
</ul>

I know, excuses, excuses. I have a few post ideas brewing and I have a two week business trip coming up which means plenty of idle hotel time to write. Hopefully I'll get the juices flowing again.
