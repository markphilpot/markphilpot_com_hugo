Thanks to <a href="https://www.hulu.com">hulu.com</a>, I caught Titan A.E. which I hadn't seen since I saw it in the theater (hard to believe that was only 8 years ago... seems like SO long ago). Anyway, I had forgotten what an awesome soundtrack it had. Here's <em>It's My Turn to Fly</em> by The Urge

One of those great "Danger Zone"-esque songs. Incredibly cheesy, but gets you incredibly pumped when you hear it. There weren't any good youtube videos of it (quality wise) so I'm using <a href="https://www.imeem.com">imeem</a>, which while it has its faults, at least has higher quality audio. You might have to login to hear the whole thing... I don't know exactly how it works yet.
