<i class="fa-regular fa-envelope" style="color: #820333"></i> Mail Client  
[Mimestream](https://mimestream.com)

I was a devout web client proponent for a long time, but at some point, the Gmail UX became so cluttered and busy, it required me to use [Simplify](https://simpl.fyi), a web extension to "clean up" the default gmail user interface. As I was experimenting with alternate browsers, extension support became spotty, so I needed to find an alternative. Mimestream finally emerged from a very long beta process and I found it to be a better option. I think I would prefer going back to using Simplify, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

<i class="fa-regular fa-note-sticky" style="color: #8EA8F4"></i> Notes  
Personal - [Bear](https://bear.app)  
Work - [Notion](https://notion.so)

As an early adopter of Bear, I was desperately waiting for its version 2 upgrade.  I was *this* close to switching to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), but after years of waiting, they recently released the long-awaited upgrade, and I'm now a happy camper.  I really do not *like* Notion, but I have to admit there is no better option if collaboration is a must.

 <i class="fa-regular fa-square-check" style="color: #ea33f7"></i>  To-Do  
[Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/)

Another one with a long wait for an update that recently arrived. So far, I think version 4 is... *OK*. It still does what I need it to do (I'm not a scripting power user, but I need more than just basic Reminders) and switching costs are high.

 <i class="fa-regular fa-images" style="color: #2a66d8"></i>  Photo Management  
[Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com)

I'm a long-time Lightroom user (back in the *Classic* era) and for the most part, I'm onboard with Adobe's modernization of the product. I hate that there are still disparities between the desktop application and the iPad version, but I've also given up on the thought that I can realistically solo travel with just an iPad, so that frustration has waned a bit.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-day" style="color: #6bc953"></i>  Calendar  
[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)

I'm not a calendar power user, but I do need more than the built-in apps from Apple or Google. I get grumpy every time I need to jump over to the Google Calendar web interface to get something done, but that's become less of an issue over time.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-cloud-arrow-up" style="color: #5d8ff7"></i>  Cloud File Storage  
Dropbox, iCloud

Dropbox is the default, iCloud for app storage.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-rss" style="color: #605c57"></i>  RSS  
[Reeder](https://reederapp.com)

RSS powers my information consumption, and I really like Reeder.  My RSS reader is one app that I really need to have on all my devices, and thankfully Reeder fits that bill exceptionally well.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-globe" style="color: #433d83"></i>  Browser  
*It's Complicated...*  
  
Default - [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/) (Firefox fallback when a site doesn't behave)  
Web Development - [Arc](https://arc.net)  
Extension Development - Chrome, Firefox, Safari

I would use Safari except for one absolute dealbreaker: When you specify a "Homepage" for new tabs (I prefer the fantastic [A Fine Start](https://afinestart.me/bookmarks/)) Safari inexplicably removes focus from the address bar!  So you can't ⌘T to a new tab and start typing a url or history search.  It's absolutely maddening!  Orion at least gives me the lightweight browser and sane behavior defaults.

I use Arc for active web development (I prefer Chromium dev tools to any of the other options).

 <i class="fa-regular fa-comments"></i>  Chat  
iMessage

Bare bones for a chat app, but universal enough among my network to be the only viable game in town.

 <i class="fa-regular fa-bookmark" style="color: #51b1dd"></i>  Bookmarks  
[Raindrop](https://raindrop.io)

I save for later and batch curate.  Raindrop also fills my "Read Later" need (I might benefit from a more dedicated service, but this works well enough for me.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-cart-shopping" style="color: #4ba0db"></i>  Shopping Lists  
[Anylist](https://www.anylist.com)

I just get by with the free version, as I'm not sure that I can get my family to adopt something like this; it's more than enough for a recurring grocery list.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-music" style="color: #dba33a"></i>  Music  
[Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/)

I use [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) as my media backend, and Plexamp is actually a decent music playing app on all the platforms I use.  I still mostly buy my core listening music and use Amazon Music and [Sonos Radio](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/sonos-radio) for everything else.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-microphone-lines" style="color: #ec8535"></i>  Podcasts  
[Overcast](https://overcast.fm)

I was a long time [Downcast](https://www.downcastapp.com) user, but eventually ran into enough quirks and bugs that it felt like the right time to switch.  I don't have power user needs here -- I only listen to a handful of podcasts at the end of the day.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-key" style="color: #a7cafb"></i>  Password Management  
[1Password](https://1password.com)

I feel like the quality of the app has been on the decline, but the family password management is essential, and I refuse to tie my passwords to a platform vendor (when I use multiple platforms).  I really hope they can right the ship and polish up the user experience.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-cloud-sun-rain" style="color: #367bf6"></i>  Weather  
[Carrot](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/)

A weather app with personality.  Enough said.

### Some Development Apps & Utilities

 <i class="fa-regular fa-keyboard" style="color: #552382"></i>  Launcher  
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)

I have been tempted by [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com), but really Alfred does everything I require it to.  It also serves as my clipboard manager, which is a must-have.

 <i class="fa-regular fa-keyboard" style="color: #ea552e"></i>  Code Editor  
[Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (IDEA, WebStorm)  
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

In reality, they are converging.  I've bounced between both.  Intellij has better end to end integration, whereas VS Code is a great light-weight editor.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-code" style="color: #682d89"></i>  Scratch Editor  
[Tot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483?mt=12) & [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

I love Tot as a place to just put random text that I will need at some point.  Sublime I use for scratch and a shell buffer.

 <i class="fa-solid fa-terminal" style="color: #6be44e"></i>  Terminal  
[iTerm](https://iterm2.com)

Been using iTerm2 since... forever? I could probably get away with just using the bare terminal, but Apple isn't concerned about the terminal experience, so I would rather be using an app by a developer that cares.
