Yes, Duke lost to UCONN on Saturday... it was a tough loss, because it is definitely a game we could have (and should have) won. It will take a while to get over. The guts and desire shown by Chris Duhon this season and been nothing short of incredible. I will definitely miss him, and I hope he does well at the next level.

Here's to next season... first official day of practice about 190 days away.

(There are lots of other stuff I could comment on, but I just don't feel quite up to it at the moment...)

Next Play
