If you have access to HBO, I highly recommend "Deadwood." I've been very impressed with HBO's original programming (I not ashamed to say I really enjoyed the last season of Sex and the City). There are some really interesting characters, and HBO's ability to go no-holds-barred into a script because they don't have to worry about sensors really comes through (though Ann does object to the extensive use of "cocksucker"... no idea how authentic that is) =)
