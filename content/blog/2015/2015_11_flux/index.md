I think I tried [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) a year or so ago, and uninstalled it soon after without really giving it a shot. I wish I had stuck with it a bit more because having recently rediscovered it, I think it's making a big difference.

If you've never heard of f.lux, it is a program for OSX, <s>iOS</s>, Windows & Linux that changes the overall color temperature of your display in the evening by dramatically reducing the amount of red light.

> We know that night-time exposure to blue light keeps people up late. We believe that f.lux adjusts colors in a way that greatly reduces the stimulating effects of blue light at night.

When I first tried it, the red hue looked awful -- I couldn't imagine using it full time. I think my problem was I installed it at night and it immediately took out all the blue so my eyes never gradually adjusted. I'm not sure what caused me to try it again, but now I can't imagine not using it, and I wish I could actually configure my TV with the same setting when doing just casual watching.

My recommendation is to install it during the day. When it transitions to _Sunset_ and then _Bedtime_ it transitions gradually (you can change that if you wish). I also recommend picking custom colors and setting _Sunset_ to about 50% and _Bedtime_ to around 20%. The initial defaults are more extreme in the temperature adjustment and could be a bit off putting if you aren't used to it.

Unfortunately Apple won't let the app on the App Store and recently issued a cease and desist notice when they tried to distribute the source code so users could side load the app with a developer account. That just royally sucks and I'll probably have more to say on that topic later.

My one complaint is that there is a limit to the amount of customization you can do. For example, when _Sunset_ and _Bedtime_ occur is determined by your geo location and as far as I can tell can't be changed. I also would have liked a simple Pause/Resume control from the menu bar.

Overall however, I'm sold. f.lux has become a permanent addition to all my computers and I really hope I can get it on my iPhone & iPad soon.
