Check <a href="https://eobadmin.gsfc.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17542" title="I hope I get to go to space someday">this</a> out too... There really is something awe inspiring about something this simple. I hope in my lifetime I have a chance to see the Earth from a distance where it looks like an IMAX projection. I hope that I get to see the moon so that the surface from horizon to horizon spans what the eye can see.

Realistically, I think my grand children will get that chance. I know we can do a lot in 40 or 60 years, but I believe we will have other pressing issues on our hands such that space travel will be still be relegated to the Air Force elite. Personally, I can't believe it's coming up on 50 years and we still haven't been back to the moon in person. The stuff the Mars landers have discovered just begs for a human mission.

And now at this point... I will turn in for the night =)

Dreaming big...
