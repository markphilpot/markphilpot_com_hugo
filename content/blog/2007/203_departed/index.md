What a fantastic movie! Just got around to watching it. In my opinion, much better than 'Goodfellas,' which is a feat unto itself.

We also saw 'Stranger Than Fiction' last weekend. Will Ferrel should do more movies like this. He really is a great actor that could branch out if he wanted to.

Anyway, let me conclude this short post with a nice picture from the Cherry Blossom festival.
