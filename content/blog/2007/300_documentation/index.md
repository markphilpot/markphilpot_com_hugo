<em>&lt;rant&gt;</em>

If you are going to document your software/middle-ware/project... hell anything, it does no good to document values without telling us what those values are!!

For example, if you have a java configuration file, and the property is something like

system.important.function

And your documentation says that the possible values are

foo|bar|nuts

Without telling us the behavior differences of each value, you've screwed up. Documentation is not self documenting damnit!

<em>&lt;/rant&gt;</em>
