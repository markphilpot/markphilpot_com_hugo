The more obvious ones I got, but the sheer expanse of tie-ins to <a href="https://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2007/12/09/a-special-where-s-wall-e-edition-of-why-for.aspx##">other projects</a> is really remarkable! Additionally, I'm very excited for the WALL-E movie... I'm hoping it continue the quality production and story that <em>Ratatouille</em> ushered in. The crew they have going there and the consistency of the story telling as almost usurped Disney completely. I know it was a different era and basically different medium (hand-drawn cell art vs. computer animation), but compare these two runs (and note, I've only picked out the "best" Disney classics, at least in my opinion... they have had quite a few that wouldn't be considered classics)

## Disney

- Snow White
- Pinocchio
- Fantasia
- Dumbo
- Bambi
- Cinderella
- Lady and the Tramp
- Sleeping Beauty
- Robin Hood
- The Little Mermaid
- Beauty and the Beast
- Aladdin
- The Lion King

## Pixar

- Toy Story
- A Bug's Life
- Toy Story 2
- Monsters, Inc.
- Finding Nemo
- The Incredibles
- Cars
- Ratatouille
- WALL-E

And note, Disney has almost had a century-long head start!
