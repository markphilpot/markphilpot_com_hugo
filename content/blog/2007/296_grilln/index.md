So I broke in our new charcoal grill <strike>last night</strike> night-before-last with pretty decent success. I forgot how much more challenging charcoal is versus gas (sadly they don't allow gas on our balcony). Did a thin beef cut with corn (and warmed up some sausages on the side). Its going to take a bit of practice to master how to keep things from burning at the onset and how to keep the coals hot for longer cooking excursions. I didn't think I used enough charcoal, but it thankfully got everything cooked. It was really satisfying actually, albeit disorganized because nothing was arranged correctly.
