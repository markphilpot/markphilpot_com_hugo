Basically this is on hiatus until the middle of September (when we finally settle into our apartment on campus). I have a bunch of posts queued up, but no time/energy to follow up with them on a regular basis. I promise this will become lively again soon =) (hell, its only a few weeks anyway).

We're down in Monterey this weekend, Tahoe next weekend, Philadelphia the following, moving/wedding in Yuba City the following, GSB events the following... basically we're booked. Hopefully things will feel less stressed here once we can settle into a routine.

I know I promised Grand Canyon pictures, but I still haven't had a chance to even look at them myself, so I'm queuing everything up until September when I finally get a chance to build my new desktop... I'll actually post the proposed specs later today and see what you think =)
