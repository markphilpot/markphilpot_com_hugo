When I stumbled across <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1120619888350136916" title="Wow, nerves of steel">this</a>, my first reaction was "You have to be crazy!"

I haven't been either sky diving or bungee jumping, and I don't really care to. Joel actually when sky diving between high school and college... He did a tandem jump, and was unaware during the jump, but their primary chute failed, so they had to deploy their reserve. That is something I'll simply avoid for a long while. I'd much rather save my money for a zero gravity trip (either in orbit a few years down the line or a 747 parabolic trip, like they used on <em>Apollo 13</em>).
