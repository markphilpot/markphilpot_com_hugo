I was lucky enough to get out of work early today. Everything went pretty well on the AFB in prep for tomorrow's testing, so I managed to head out to Pismo Beach, grab some BBQ, and walk around the beach for a bit. I hadn't packed anything appropriate (didn't think I'd have any daylight downtime), so I headed over to the local outlets, bought a new swimsuit and sandals, and enjoyed the sunshine.

There are a number of reasons why we can't wait to get back to California and this is one of the big ones. Enjoying great weather on the beach does wonders for your piece of mind. While it was still windy and only mild, it's still loads better then schlepping around either a frigid or a muggy DC. It really does have a powerful effect.
