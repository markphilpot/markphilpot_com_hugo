<a href="https://www.millenniumpong.com/" title="Reminds me of junior year">This</a> is ambitious! Enjoy a trip back to the good old college days.

<em>Note</em> -- Just FYI, you don't play beer pong with paddles... for some reason I have heard that certain places on the west coast (that shall go unnamed) call beer pong without paddles 'Beirut' (thank's for the catch Jeff). Let me put that to rest. Beer pong is beer pong... If you're playing with paddles, there is no beer involved.

<em>Note<sup>2</sup></em> -- Flip-cup is a great one if you have more than four people. Quarters is a great classic too, though you have to be willing to sacrifice the table.
