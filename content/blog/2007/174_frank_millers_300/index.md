Arriving in theaters this Friday is the latest adaptation of a Frank Miller comic, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/" title="Just simply, WOW">300</a> -- and I've been looking forward to it for months. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/">Sin City</a> broke the ground with the novel green screen work that gives both films such a great comic look and feel. Sin City was a collection of short stories interwoven into a feature length film. 300 looks to be a much more intense single story surrounding a legendary battle between an out numbered army of Spartans and the entire Persian army. In true Frank Miller fashion it looks to be a true "graphic novel," sparing no expense on blood and violence -- fantastic.

Ann and I are out in the Bay Area next weekend for Stanford's admit weekend, so we probably won't catch this until the following weekend. I'll try to give a review as soon as I see it.
