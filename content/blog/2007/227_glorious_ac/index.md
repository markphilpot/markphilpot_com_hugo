Finally!

We have central heating and AC -- which basically means we have no control over anything. Either heat or AC (no fan option). Which means usually a miserable one to two weeks biannually where they turn the AC off too early (fall) or wait too late (spring). Well today will be the best night of sleep all week as they finally kicked on the AC. While the humidity hasn't quite crept up on us, its still much more humid here than anywhere in California (though not quite North Carolina or Alabama). At least at Duke we had legions of fans running 24x7 to at least circulate the air. Here, if I turned on the fan yesterday, I'd get 80 degree heated air blasting us.

So... Now a nice night of sleep awaits.
