To anyone who watched Firefly & <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">Serenity</a>, you understand how I feel about the actors. I loved the characters they portrayed, and once it went riding off into the sunset on the silver screen (well before its time), I want the actors to at least go on to bigger projects... hoping to see them once again on screen. I thought I would gather up some information on what they've been up to (mostly via <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">imdb</a>, albeit).

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/">Joss Whedon</a>
<ul>
	<li>Its unfortunately been a rough time for Joss.  After Serenity made its run through the theaters, he was tapped to write a Wonder Woman screenplay.  After working on it for about a year, the studio decided it wasn't working and moved on.  I'm not sure what he's been up to since, but imdb has a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481738/" title="Goners">mysterious project</a> listed... though no one seems to know exactly what it is.  So I guess we're in a wait and see mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277213/">Nathan Fillion</a>
<ul>
	<li>There is no reason why he can't be the next Harrison Ford if given the chance (and Ann agrees... an even better one).  Ann and I this past weekend supported our local indy theater with a showing of Namesake (a fantastic movie by the way... highly recommended... and apparently a very good book -- Ann read it).  I got very excited during the previews seeing the trailer for his <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473308/" title="Waitress">next film</a>.  Looks to be a small film with a good cast.  I never did see Slither... just not my cup of tea.  But hopefully there is more mainstream work coming his way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868659/">Gina Torres</a>
<ul>
	<li>I haven't seen the movie yet, but Gina has a part in Chris Rock's latest <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770772/">I Think  I Love My Wife</a>.  Looks like she just completed another <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478273/" title="South of Pico">project</a>, though I don't know anything about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876138/">Alan Tudyk</a>
<ul>
	<li>Apparently a very good voice actor, did work on both Ice Age movies.  After doing a bit of CSI work, has done two films, unfortunately both unknown to me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1072555/">Morena Baccarin</a><img src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/26/45969179_a10ba39783_m.jpg" title="Morena" alt="Morena" style="float: right" height="240" width="160" />
<ul>
	<li>I just don't understand why studios aren't knocking down the door for her.  Looks like she's been making the TV rounds (Stargate SG-1, Las Vegas, Justice, OC).</li>
	<li>She is just knock your socks off pretty...</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000284/">Adam Baldwin</a>
<ul>
	<li>Another one doing TV and voice work.  He had actually done quite a bit of TV work prior to Firefly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0821612/">Jewel Staite</a>
<ul>
	<li>Another Stargate appearance (Atlantis this time), and completing work on a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811124/" title="The Tribe">film</a> for next year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0536883/">Sean Maher</a>
<ul>
	<li>Looks like a handful of projects... On a side note... Party of Five??  Anyway, I can't imagine how hard it is to make it in the entertainment business with the limited amount of work they seem to do a year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1132359/">Summer Glau</a>
<ul>
	<li>Again, more work on television (though it looks more substantial) with The Unit and The Sarah Connor Chronicles.  I think there was rumored somewhere she was going to play a Terminator on the latter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322002/">Ron Glass </a>
<ul>
	<li>More TV work for Ron.  He's done actually quite a bit in his career.  When I first checked his page on imdb, it was barely filled in, aside from Firefly & Serenity.  He has been around the block!  Hasn't done much since Serenity though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

So there you have it. A one stop shop recap. Hope you enjoyed this edition. Stay tuned for more (maybe an annual thing...)
