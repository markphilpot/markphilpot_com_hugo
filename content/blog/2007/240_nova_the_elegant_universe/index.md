You have to love public television. PBS has made the complete Nova production Elegant Universe <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program_d_t.html">available online</a>. If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend it. The TV production is a bit overly dramatic, but incredibly well done nonetheless. Greene is a great writer and is able to breakdown incredibly abstract subjects like string and quantum theories so they are digestible by everyone.

The television production is three hours, so you might want to break it up rather than all three in one sitting. Its a really exciting time for theoretical science, and its come to a point where its so abstract that laymen can no longer follow along -- you have to remember Einstein was a virtually a celebrity during the hight of his contributions.
