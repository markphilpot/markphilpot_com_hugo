A virtual unknown here in the States, <a href="https://www.nightwish.com">Nightwish</a> is a huge act in Europe. Hailing from Finland, their first singer gave them a very unique sound -- a very operatic voice prevented them sounding like Evanescence (even though they predated the US act by almost a decade). Tarja Turunen was quite literally an opera singer fronting a heavy metal band. They split ways two years ago due to creative differences, and Nightwish spent a year and a half looking for a new female front (wo)man. Looks like they finally found one... Their new album Dark Passion Play was released this week in Europe and their single Amaranth is #1 in a few countries. I don't have the album yet, but I like the single. Unfortunately a little close to Evanescence, but better sounding IMO (a little like <a href="https://www.within-temptation.com/">Within Temptation</a>). I think their new singer Anette Olzo will be much more palatable to a larger audience (and being pretty damn cute at the same time... always key). I don't like the video all that much, but the song is definitely catchy.

> Baptised with a perfect name The doubting one by heart Alone without himself

> War between him and the day Need someone to blame In the end, little he can do alone

> You believe but what you see You receive but what you give

> Caress the one, the Never-Fading Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow Caress the one, the hiding amaranth In a land of the daybreak

> Apart from the wandering pack In this brief flight of time we reach For the ones, whoever dare

> You believe but what you see You receive but what you give

> Caress the one, the Never-Fading Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow Caress the one, the hiding amaranth In a land of the daybreak

> Reaching, searching for something untouched Hearing voices of the Never-Fading calling

> Caress the one, the Never-Fading Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow Caress the one, the hiding amaranth In a land of the daybreak
