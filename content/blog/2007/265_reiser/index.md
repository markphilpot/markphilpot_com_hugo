I am only superficially aware of the murder allegations surrounding Hans Reiser (creator of the ReiserFS), but this <a href="https://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-07/ff_hansreiser?currentPage=1" title="in our own backyard">Wired article</a> is shocking, disturbing, and incredibly well written. Wired in general has particularly good writers on staff, but this expose is incredibly poignant.

Since the Duke Lacrosse case everyone is especially careful about any presumption of guilt prior to having all the facts. However, with the description of what is currently in the public area, this literally could have come straight from a Law & Order/CSI episode. It is really, really sad to see what rock bottom looks like.
