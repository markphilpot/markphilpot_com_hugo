Personally, I think the entire cast of Firefly/<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">Serenity</a> is under appreciated. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277213/">Nathan</a> has the biggest potential, but as this comment displays, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876138/">Alan</a> is probably the <a href="https://www.filmwad.com/the-alan-tudyk-effect-4621-p.html">most versatile</a>, and I completely agree with the sentiment. I haven't seen <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381849/">3:10 to Yuma</a> yet, but it has received some great press and reviews. He is the unsung hero that everyone loves.

I also picked up the collectors edition of Serenity last weekend. There are a few extra bonus features and an extra commentary track, but really its supporting the franchise in hope of seeing a Serenity 2. With Joss loosing Wonder Woman, I'm not sure what his next project, but some executive at Universal really needs to get with it and green light a sequel. It would be literally like printing money and they already have a huge following to do the leg work for PR!
