Crap. You know, I never gave "social networking" sites much thought. I didn't think it would have enough draw. Now we have the start of <a href="https://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html">social analysis</a> based on which site you use, myspace or facebook. Many bands now have a presence on myspace, and I've popped in to check them out... never tried facebook. Myspace never appealed to me, but facebook's networking is certainly a draw. Being able to see people from your high school or college class is the killer feature I didn't know they had. I always thought <a href="https://www.classmates.com">Classmates.com</a> had potential if they didn't charge for damn access since they had complete rosters for high school and college classes. Facebook at least makes it voluntary, but I can see now how creating that presence in that network is a draw for many people... Ok. So I'm now on facebook. And I officially have no friends =) Brilliant.
