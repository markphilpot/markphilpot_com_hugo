Ok, I need a recommendation. For years, my sole source of quality film reviews was Roger Ebert. On roughly 90% of his reviews I agreed with. I always appreciated the fact that he knew what the film was trying to be. If it was a summer film whose purpose was simply to entertain, he respected that and he didn't pan movies because they weren't up to artistic snuff. The only movie he reviewed negatively which I thought was great was <em>Usual Suspects</em>. I appreciated his candor and respected his opinion.

Since he became ill, he has basically stopped reviewing films. I hope he continues on the road to recovery and makes it back. In the mean time (and future) I need to find another film critic who I can respect his or her opinion when making movie night decisions. Any thoughts?
