"She can't take much more captain! I'm giving her all she's got! We need to get to the Winchester!"

From the "that suddenly improved the stakes" department comes <a href="https://www.firstshowing.net/2007/10/11/no-way-simon-pegg-is-scotty-in-star-trek/">news</a> that JJ Abrams remake of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/">Star Trek</a> picked up <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0670408/">Simon Pegg</a> (Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the Dead) to play Scotty! Yes, they are going back to the original characters with a whole new cast and basically remaking the Star Trek universe. They also recently picked up Eric Bana to play the villain! All in all, they have a very young (and definitely talented) cast together for this one. I'm actually looking forward to this one!
