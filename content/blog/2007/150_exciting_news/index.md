So the fantastic news is that Ann has been accepted to the Stanford Business School!! We are so excited and I'm incredibly proud of her (I know exactly how much work she put into it). Which means that indeed 2007 will be a year of very good change and transition.

We will probably end up living on campus and heading out to the Bay Area in the July/August time frame. In the mean time, we are both incredibly busy at work -- with the Democrats taking back Congress, and lots of GPS events (and travel). I'll try to keep everyone posted on developments (no pun intended).
