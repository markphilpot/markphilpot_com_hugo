Holy... Shit.

This show is amazing! The Discovery channel blows everything else out of the water with this new mini-series! In a 40 minute show, my jaw is literally on the floor the entire time. There are shots you have just never seen before and may never again. Words are failing me.

I can't imagine this show on a large HD projection screen. Some of the high speed camera work (especially the shot of the crocodile taking the wilderbeast with the lone zebra in the shot... Wow!) is simply incredible. I'm running out of adjectives here. If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out.
