Two <a href="https://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_2.2_RC1_released" title="release candidate 1">features</a> that have been a long time coming --

<ul>
    <li>Virtual Albums -- aka "Flickr style tags"</li>
    <li>Improved Watermarking support</li>
</ul>

I've been flirting with the features and interface of <a title="the proprietary solution" href="https://www.flickr.com">Flicker</a>. There is no doubt its highly polished and feature rich, but I just couldn't do the $24/year (even though its not a bad price) and give up the control and freedom of a "host-your-own" solution like <a href="https://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery</a>. I took a quick <a title="very sparse, but you get the gist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_gallery_comparison">peek</a> at what the competition had to offer and still came back to Gallery hands down.

I really hate the enforced hierarchy of Gallery. Tags make sense for images as Flickr proves. Hopefully they put together a nice implementation.

Probably second to "Flickr-like tags" as far as number of feature requests, is more robust watermarking support. Now, you cant have a new watermark and say "apply it to all images in this album" -- you have to do it all by hand or re-upload the entire set (a serious pain).

I would expect RC-2 to appear very soon (order of weeks) with the official 2.2 release arriving around the end of March or beginning of April. The more and more I think about it, I'll probably upgrade when 2.2 RC-2 arrives so I can start playing around with the new functionality.
