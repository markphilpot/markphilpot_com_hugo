Speak of the devil, <a href="https://www.wisegeek.com/which-movie-reviews-should-i-believe.htm">here</a> is a wonderful little site that tries to identify which movie reviewer you should trust (or is at least most compatible with your likes). Unfortunately, I haven't seen about 50% of the movies listed... It did say I was most compatible with Roger Ebert, so I get the feeling it might be pretty accurate. I'm not familiar with the other names it suggests, but I'll let you know what I find.
