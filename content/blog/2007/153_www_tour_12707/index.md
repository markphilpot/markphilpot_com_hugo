<ul>
    <li><a title="Where's 3m resolution when you need it" href="https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/11jul_lroc.htm">Seeing Apollo Landing Site</a> -- When you pause and think about it, it makes sense... however the fact that Hubble can't even see it, is really rather remarkable</li>
    <li><a title="And the Evo wins!" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbdgNna5Ne0">Mitsubishi Evo 8 vs. Lamborghini Murcielago (Top Gear) </a>-- Holy shit! Incredbile! If it didn't look so bland (and its still a Mitsubishi)</li>
    <li><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2TXPFgRsVUE" title="Finish Him">Ryu vs Scorpion</a> -- Well done fight sequence. I don't think its a "game," just some video editing... but well worth it.</li>
</ul>
