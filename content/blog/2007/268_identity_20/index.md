While the subject matter is quite interesting, and very applicable to the times, take a look at <a href="https://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">this presentation</a>. That is how a powerpoint presentation is done -- maybe not quite that rapid fire, but the style and substance (based on the Lessig presentation model) is incredibly well done. Its really sad how Powerpoint's tools and layouts encourage the worst aspects of presentations (lots of text, read from the slide, etc). Powerpoint (or Keynote or any other presentation software) needs an embedded CC Flickr search engine, to encourage this sort of delivery. Hell, in high school or college, a public speaking course should be mandatory that teaches you how to make <em>good</em> presentations.
