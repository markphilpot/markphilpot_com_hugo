All I can say is... Wow!

There are only a handful of instances where I think the "HDR" effect looks good, but this is definitely one of them. I've only tried to bracket shots a few times, but I haven't been able to get good looking photos out of it. Photomatrix is the predominant software (reasonably priced at $99), but even trying the demo, I have struggled to understand what the workflow is. There are a handful of open source products out there that are coming along, but they are truly in their infancy.

Definitely check out <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/">"Stuck in Customs"</a> other work... he has some incredible stuff!
