Man! We leave the country for a few days and it seems like everything decided to hit the fan! First off, fantastic trip. Much need rest, relaxation, sun, beach, and Mexican beer. Can't ask for much more than that. I'll have details and pictures later, so stay tuned.

I currently have 14 posts in basic draft form (a 50% increase from where it was this morning as I began to peruse over all the news and events I missed), and that doesn't include anything from the trip. So needless to say, things will trickle out slowly -- I usually stick with oldest draft first... good old FIFO -- as I try to catch up with the times. Some things will probably seem like old news, but oh well. Hopefully this weekend will offer some time to recover from our vacation -- how ironic is that, but it's so true.
