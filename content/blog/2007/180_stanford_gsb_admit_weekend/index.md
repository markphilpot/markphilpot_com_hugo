It really was an exhausting, intimidating, and fun weekend (bookended by two days). A couple of points to get across before some highlights.

<ul>
	<li>In GSB terms, I am Ann's "SO" and Ann is "my Student"</li>
	<li>Stanford apparently loves their acronyms... more so that most colleges</li>
	<li>Each GSB class is<em> only</em> ~360 students (as opposed to Harvard who has ~900) -- Granted this was round one admit weekend (only about 120 students there), it feels very intimate.</li>
	<li>Moving back on campus when I'm not going to be attending classes is going to very weird</li>
	<li>We both can't wait to get back to California weather (we came back from great 80Â° sunshine, to sleet and snow and miserably cold)</li>
</ul>

The GSB community seems a fantastic fit. Because a good number of students are married, they really make sure the "SOs" are welcome and included. We get access to all the facilities and we can take all the classes (if we want/have time). There is a significant number of international students -- I think they shoot for about 25% of each class. Most of the students we met were from traditional backgrounds (investment banking, consulting... traditional business). Ann was one of the few from a non-traditional background. But it was intimidating when you realized the exceptional backgrounds of the people who will be your classmates.

All in all, it was overwhelming but at the same time very exciting. We didn't want to head back to DC (of course heading back to a sleet storm didn't help). Trying to plan things out, it looks like we'll move out in the last week of July, take a nice road trip via Hwy 40, and arrive in the Bay Area in the middle of August.

I was able to get some of the new panos from the trip done. I'll post more later, but in the mean time you can head over to my gallery and check them out.
