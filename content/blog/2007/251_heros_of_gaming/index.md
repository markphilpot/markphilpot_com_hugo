Its definitely nice to see <a href="https://www.ragnartornquist.com/">Ragnar's</a> characters getting a little <a href="https://www.gamelemon.com/article_30009.jsp">love</a>. Zoe and April come in 4th on a list of top 25 Video Game Heroes. I don't think it is without merit either. The Longest Journey and Dreamfall have some of the deepest and satisfying protagonists in gaming. I still need to try Indigo Prophecy which I hear is just as deep.

Ragnar's new project, <a href="https://www.darkdaysarecoming.com/">The Secret World</a> was announced a few months ago but no additional details, as of yet. We know its not a followup to TLJ and its going to be a MMORG, which I'm not a big fan of. I never really saw the attraction of WoW... and its hard to get over the monthly fee to continue playing. Still, I'm definitely curious. Unfortunately, this probably means the followup to Dreamfall is years away.
