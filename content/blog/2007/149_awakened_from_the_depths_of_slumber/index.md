Wow, has it been this long? Anyone who ever checked this must have given up by now. Talk about killing your audience through inactivity.

Let me be the first to say, the spell checker in Firefox 2 is really nice to have. It unfortunately doesn't quite work with the editor I'm using right now (ChenPress -- the right click doesn't show the alternative spellings) but at least I get a red underline when its wrong. For reasons that will become clear soon, I'm basically doing the equivalent of a good dusting throughout the site. Fill in those few areas I've been meaning to get to but haven't.

I hope to have a movie review up soon, as well as a great announcement... so stay tuned.
