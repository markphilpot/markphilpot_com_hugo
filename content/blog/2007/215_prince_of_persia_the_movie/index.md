When it comes to successful rebirths of a video game franchise, the most recent stellar performer must be Prince of Persia. It came a long way from its primitive beginnings on early Macintosh platforms. Even then it was still a great game. Ubisoft did a remarkable job with the original remake (<em>The Sands of Time</em>) and eventually put out one of the most successful video game trilogy's of all time (<em>Warrior Within</em> and <em>Two Thrones</em>) -- all three of which I throughly enjoyed.

It has <a href="https://www.filmwad.com/prince-of-persia-to-reign-on-silver-screen-2196-p.html">come to light</a> that Disney has teamed up with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000988/" title="The Rock is still a great movie">Jerry Bruckheimer</a> to make a movie version of the first video game, <em>Sands of Time</em>. Let me first say at the moment I can't recall a single good video-game-to-movie adaptation -- and there have been some really bad ones of late _cough_ <em>DOOM</em> _cough_. When you combine that with Disney's propensity to mess good things up and Bruckheimer's tendency for the overly dramatic _cough_ <em>Pearl Harbor</em> _cough_ <em>Armageddon</em> _cough_ I don't think I'll ever get above "cautiously optimistic" for this one. However, it sounds like, they are following the Pirates of the Caribbean model where they loosely construct a new story around the original concept. With no casting revealed as yet, we have no idea if Johnny Depp will be cast to single handedly make the film good.
