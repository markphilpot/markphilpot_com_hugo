The <a href="https://movies.yahoo.com/feature/stardust.html;_ylt=AgP1ctZ.TL6.yeJ3.WQxoD5fVXcA" title="Stardust">trailer</a> is finally out (there was a very crude Russian version floating around the web) and it looks great! Just check out the cast! -- Robert De Niro, Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Evertt, Ian McKellen, Peter O'Toole... I mean... WOW! It's apparently based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, though I've never heard of either. It <a href="https://www.stardustmovie.com" title="Official site">looks</a> like a wonderful fantasy in the vein of Alice in Wonderland crossed with a Grimm fairy tale and cured with a good pirate story. Definitely something worth seeing in my mind =)

Also hoping to see <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/">300</a> this weekend...
