This weekend was quite literally a gut check. Summarized in spectacular powerpoint fashion...

<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Vista is quite possibly the worst f*cking software ever written.  Ever. Period. End of Story.</li>
	<li>Weekend-long pounding stress headaches suck.  SUCK SUCK SUCK.</li>
	<li>Building a computer from scratch got a lot more complicated in 8 years.  Building a computer with a pounding stress headache is a fracking awful.</li>
	<li>Hard drives arriving DOA (complete with that sickening head clicking) SUCK.</li>
	<li>And I thought ATI was bad... Nvidia (and ATI) need to get their act together and polish their linux drivers... and make sure your installer works!</li>
	<li>Alberto Milone is a SAINT!!  Wrote a great python script (<a href="https://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html">Envy</a>) that does a video driver installer better than Nvidia or ATI (f*ck nuts)</li>
	<li>Discovering Envy after a day and a half of manual tweaking SUCKS!</li>
	<li>Figuring how to reconnect my home theater system is always much more trouble that it should be.</li>
</ul>

But now to the accomplishments

<ul>
	<li>Now have a nice dual screen, dual booting (WinXP & Kubuntu) system.  Kubuntu has the right video driver (although the X-fi isn't supported yet... Oh... Creative sucks too for that, but at least I have sound out the motherboard).  I wasn't able to do virtualization on a raw partition... baby steps, but I'll be able to setup a VM of Windows 2000 to cover basic windows tasks, and I'll only have to move over to WinXP for gaming or final photoshop production -- a step in the right direction.</li>
	<li>Have a brand spanking new 42" LCD HDTV.  Went with Visio from Costco... definitely looks and feels a little on the cheap end, but the picture quality is great (and its 1080p for a little more than $1000).  The HDTV cable box comes on Friday.  I also need to go buy an upcoverting DVD player.</li>
	<li>After cursing out Vista to no end on Sunday, I finally got my PDA (its a fucking Dell windows mobile 5!) to sync for Ann to use (today is her first day... wow that's weird).</li>
</ul>

To Do Items

<ul>
	<li>Buy a Weber grill (only allowed charcoal unfortunately), so I can start cooking.</li>
	<li>Buy new DVD player.</li>
	<li>Setup computer software.</li>
	<li>Install bike stand</li>
	<li>Get car washed...</li>
	<li>etc, etc.</li>
</ul>
