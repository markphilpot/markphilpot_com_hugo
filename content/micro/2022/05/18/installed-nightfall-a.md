Installed [Nightfall](https://github.com/r-thomson/Nightfall) -- a simple menubar app to toggle between light and dark modes. Why something like this isn't available by default boggles my mind. I can now go through all my apps to make sure they follow the system setting.

Except for iTerm of course which gets permanent dark mode status.
