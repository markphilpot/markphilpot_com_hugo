A [post](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) from Josh Comeau's blog, "The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility" --

> The truth is, if you want to build the most-accessible product possible, you need to use both pixels and ems/rems. It's not an either/or situation. There are circumstances where rems are more accessible, and other circumstances where pixels are more accessible.

This is one of the best breakdowns of `px/em/rem` you will ever find. *Highly* recommended reading.
