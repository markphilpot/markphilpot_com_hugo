Mastodon thoughts -- If you are on a popular server, the federated timeline (and possibly the local timeline) are too overwhelming to be useful. My goal is to run my own server which will actually give me a useful federated timeline by running some secondary accounts that I control. That way I can have my "Home" timeline be my direct follows and my federated timeline be a bit broader but still within my direct control.
