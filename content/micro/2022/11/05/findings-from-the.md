Findings from "The Great Follow Backup" (aka diversify my social follow graph)

Based on the bios in my Twitter follows, here's a rough breakdown on where everyone is:

- pixiv (and/or fanbox)
- patreon
- instagram
- github
- ko-fi
- tumblr
- youtube/twitch
- wordpress/blog (aka RSS)
- none

Many people only had a personal website (like a portfolio) that only had "resume-like" evergreen content -- these people obviously considered Twitter as their microblog/social post platform. Less than 1% had a mastodon "backup" account linked.

I feel better having made the effort -- if Twitter goes belly up, I can at least get back to some of the people I follow.
