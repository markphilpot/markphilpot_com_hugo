For the most part, Twitter has been a consumption feed for me. I follow a few key individuals from a diverse set of interests -- essentially a short form RSS reader with the ability to reply and engage inline. That engagement wasn't frequent, but it felt nice to be able to participate.

Mastodon is too chaotic right now for me to discern what it will mean to me (too much of the feed is wrapped up with Twitter imploding to have its identity at the moment). Since I have set up my own domain (@mark@philpot.org) maybe it can become a place for soundboarding ideas (turn a hashtag into a blog post for example).

This post could have been put in Mastodon only (broken up in separate posts, obviously) -- I haven't decided what goes where. There are even more possibilities than there were, and I already thought I had too many options before.
