My #project tonight was to make my micro.blog site have the same theme as my main blog. Now they feel "of a piece."

Never did much with hugo before, and while a bit finicky to setup, I have to admit it is extremely fast (especially coming from gatsby)

Now the "micro" content seems like it just lives in a separate subdomain. I'm considering tweaking the main blog back to having only the big posts.
