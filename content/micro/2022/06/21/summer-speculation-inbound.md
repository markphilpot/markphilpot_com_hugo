Summer 2022 speculation inbound!

![](https://micro.markphilpot.com/uploads/2022/d0defc54ac.png)

Notably absent here is [Lucifer and Biscuit Hammer](https://anilist.co/anime/144323) - literally everyone who was a fan of the manga has panned everything to do with this adaptation (very sad, but I'll just have to pick up the manga at some point).

I've been putting off watching the [Made in Abyss](https://anilist.co/anime/100643) movie, saving my soul from the feels... Now I have a deadline.
