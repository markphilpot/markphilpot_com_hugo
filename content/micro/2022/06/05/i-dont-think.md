I don't think I've ever mentioned it, but I love [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) -- I get *so* much value out of my monthly subscription. Every so often, I revisit the list of apps to see if there is anything new that I can incorporate into my workflow.

Today's discovery is [OpenIn](https://loshadki.app/openin/) -- a clever little app that allows me to configure a set of rules to customize what happens when I click a link. Here's what I initially came up with:

1. Open `localhost` in Chrome
2. ‚å• mod click to pop up a list of browsers
3. Default open in Firefox

Having a curated list of apps that solves small pain points is extremely handy. Highly recommended!
