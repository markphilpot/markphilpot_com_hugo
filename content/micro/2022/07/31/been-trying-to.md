Been trying to use [Orion](https://browser.kagi.com) as my daily browser for the last week. It's promise of using Webkit (and the clean UI look of Safari) with Firefox/Chrome extension compatibility was a big selling point. I've also been trying to use [Kagi](https://kagi.com) as my default search engine.

The latter has been going better than the former.

The browser compatibility is very rough and has a bunch of bugs (it's still in beta, so that's not that surprising). There are a few UI quirks that are making it difficult to fully adopt, but it's really close. I like the idea of diversifying my tech stack and I'm hoping Orion improves over time.
