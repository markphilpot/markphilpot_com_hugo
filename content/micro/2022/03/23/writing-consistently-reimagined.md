My first writing online some (checking the records) *19* years ago (yes, my "[first post](https://markphilpot.com/posts/2003/04/29/and_then_there_was)" was on April 29, 2003) predated the first Wordpress release by a few months. (I must have used MovableType at the time)

> Yes, this is the first entry in my weblog (blog). Though I guess I'm kind of late, since "everyone must be doing this." Well, in all likelihood, this will get very few views (and fewer comments), but hell, why not right?

*weblog -- how quaint*

I think I had a "personal website" since 1998 or so, but this new blogging thing was (hopefully) a way to reduce the friction for writing. My blog has been through multiple services and is now a statically generated site ([markphilpot.com](https://markphilpot.com)). Intellectually I prefer it this way, but the result has such a high degree of friction that I'm never able to capture a fleeting moment when I feel inspired to write a few words.

To be honest, that's not the only obstacle getting in my way -- I have no idea why my own idea of a blog with higher production values (e.g. edge to edge images) is really needed.

So let's try this again. It doesn't need to be perfect -- just an excuse to exercise my writing muscles every once in a while.

And yes, I had to resist the urge to go hunt down an image for this post.

*sigh*
