Experimenting with micro publishing from Ulysses to Micro.blog.

Testing out the update flow.

Still need to figure out how to "organize" Ulysses for this.

Editing this from an iPad. Very much enjoying the experience. Somehow hit a bug where by accidentally creating a draft post, there are two "instances" of this post. Will have to be careful about cross post editing between iPad and Mac.
