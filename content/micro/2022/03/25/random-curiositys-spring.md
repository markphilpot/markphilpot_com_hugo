Random Curiosity's [Spring Preview](https://randomc.net/2022/03/24/spring-2022-preview/) came out last night and *oh boy* is this a stacked season! So many sequels to series I loved the first (or second) time around. I never finished the first season *Shield Hero* so that isn't immediately on this list.

Winter was very mild this year -- only picked up two new shows, so I was able to make some backlog progress. That's definitely not happening this quarter.

*Side note -- So much isekai...*
