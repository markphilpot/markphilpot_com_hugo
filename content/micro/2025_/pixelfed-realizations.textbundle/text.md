In adding my pixelfed account to Ivory, it drives home that it really is just another ActivityPub server (no different from any other Mastodon instance) where the users have collectively agreed (for the most part) to post images instead of text.  It really is an ActivityPub *client* rather than a different service. I think I'd rather just boot posts from my main account instead of bifurcating things.
