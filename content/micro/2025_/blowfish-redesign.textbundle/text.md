Using a blog redesign to try to get you to write more?  Who would do such a thing?!

The same spirit is there, but in moving over to [blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme as the foundation hopefully means a theme stack that's a bit more up to date (and as a bonus still actively maintained).  I'll have to figure out how to manage upgrading the core theme while maintaining my tweaks, but that is a project for another day.  So far I've been impressed with the stack -- it's well organized and doesn't feel like a spaghetti project.  There are a few shortcodes that need updating, so I'll have to go back through old posts to make sure things still work (should be fairly manageable).

I'm still working on my POSSE extensions, so expect a longer post on that soon (hopefully)
