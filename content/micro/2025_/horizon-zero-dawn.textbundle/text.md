Horizon Zero Dawn (w/ Frozen Wilds)

I know I'm a little late to the party with this one, but this game was magnificent. The story and world building were especially on point. I tried really hard to take a stealth approach to combat but it only get's you so far before it's an all out melee. I can't wait to dive into *Forbidden West*

9/10
