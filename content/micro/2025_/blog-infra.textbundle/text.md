Managed to upgrade hugo and my blowfish theme in one fell swoop.  It doesn't help that I have customized branches for both (and for hugo I need to produce an ARM binary for local development and x86-64 binary for CI deployment).  I almost gave up a few times, but glad I pushed through to the end.

Having to use a custom build of your static blogging engine always has me eyeing the greener grass on the other side of the fence.  If I were to start from scratch at this point, [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) would probably be my first choice, but that requires a huge amount of work at this point.  It would be less daunting if I was starting something from square one, but having a back catalog using at least three different file structures and frontmatter conventions... just, ugh.

And if I'm being honest, if I truly was starting from square one I would probably go with a self-hosted ghost setup, so I could keep using Ulysses for writing.
