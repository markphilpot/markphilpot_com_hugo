[Fate/strange Fake: Whispers of Dawn](https://anilist.co/anime/154966/Fatestrange-Fake-Whispers-of-Dawn/)

A Fate production not done by ufotable? Call me skeptical but A1 is probably one of the studios that might be able to do it justice. This is just "Episode 0" and very much a shotgun-style introduction of everything rather than the beginning of the story.  The full show is airing now for Winter 2025.

7/10
