I made a thing.

I finally got a keyboard stand so I could move my nice midi controller under my desk upstairs and create little things like this. Hopefully just making it easier to noodle I can spin out a bunch of one-takes like this.  Maybe it will inspire me to work on some larger Logic projects again.
