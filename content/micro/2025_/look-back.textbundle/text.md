**Look Back**

How bad do you want it? Will you do what it takes? What does art mean to you?

This film is a love letter to what it means to create.  The animation is raw, visceral, and incredibly moving. *Highly* recommended, but give yourself some extra time to sit with the experience after it's over (you will definitely need it).

9/10
