This game is amazing! The prologue is a masterclass in narrative story telling and world building. Combining Souls-like dodge/parry mechanics with turn based combat feels like a very natural match. Not having a map combined with the dungeon design makes things harder to navigate but I'm slowly getting used to it.  Highly, *highly* recommend!
