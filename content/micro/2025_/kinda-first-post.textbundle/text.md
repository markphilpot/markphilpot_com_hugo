I've wanted forever to unify my blog with both long form (essays) and short form (micro posts). And I think I've finally managed to pull it off in a way I'm happy with (not perfect mind you, but satisfactory). Will need to figure out the cross-posting bit and a more pleasant publishing step, but having them unified removes a mental hurdle I always had when writing.
