[Sasayaku You ni Koi wo Utau (Whisper Me a Love Song)](https://anilist.co/anime/160181/Sasayaku-You-ni-Koi-wo-Utau/)

Despite the production issues, I'm so glad we got this adaptation. The manga is one of my favorites and the anime feels like a complete story (and there is still lots of great story left for the manga to tell). The middle third suffers a bit from the production crunch, but the final third ultimately delivers on the promise.

8/10
