**DanMachi - Season 5**

Not quite as good as Season 4, but entertaining nonetheless.  It's not often you zag away from your harem troupes to explicitly reject one of the interests. The events of Season 5 is about where I exhaust my hazy knowledge of the source material, so I'm going in blind from here on out.

7/10
