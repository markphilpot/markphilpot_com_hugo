What with the whole SIP COVID situation, I decided I wanted to be able to noodle on some music ideas and wanted to get my home studio functioning again. Easier said than done.

Turns out my audio interface doesn't *really* work anymore, given the company behind it stopped releasing drivers a few years ago (I'm pretty sure they are essentially out of business at this point). So I unexpectedly entered the market for a new audio interface. My current leading candidate is the [MOTU M4](https://motu.com/en-us/products/m-series/m4/) but that seems to be sold out everywhere (probably due in no small part to COVID... *sigh*)

I'm also looking into a new MIDI controller since my old JV-35 has some broken keys. I was eying the Native Instruments [Komplete Kontrol s61](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-s49-s61/).  I would love to get the full 88 weighted key version, but I'm not sure I can justify the cost.

Sidenote: I'm using this post to debug my netlify cms configuration
