I have two websites that I haven't needed to touch in 6 years. I just tried to update the support address from Twitter to Mastodon, only to find that the site no longer builds or deploys. The tech stack is ancient and I'm assuming some of the libraries might not be available anymore at the versions they were pinned at.

Is it easier to re-implement in a modern stack or try to patch together what is there? I think the latter, then if that fails tackle the former -- but the former is more tempting than it has any right to be.
