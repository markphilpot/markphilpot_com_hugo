My last two remaining threads to Twitter are effectively cut — Reeder’s RSS capability and my dinky little app to get images from liked tweets are both shutdown (with no realistic hope of them ever returning). I was still getting value from my timeline via RSS, but not enough that I want to trudge through the official apps for it.
