Just finished the new *Willow* series with the kids. They loved it and it was the perfect level of nostalgia-camp for those of us who were fans of the movie as kids ourselves. Seeing Warwick Davis go from a kid in the movie to an "elder" in the series was trippy. Loved the cast. Loved the irreverent references and humor. Great fun all around.
