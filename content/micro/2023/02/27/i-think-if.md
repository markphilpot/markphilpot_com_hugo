I think if I wasn't heavily invested in [Bear.app](https://bear.app) for notes, I would readily embrace the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) ecosystem. I feel like I've been waiting for Bear 2 for years at this point and if it weren't for the faint promise of it being released sometime this year, I would probably have migrated at this point.
