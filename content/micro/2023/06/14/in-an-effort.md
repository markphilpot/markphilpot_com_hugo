In an effort to both reduce the subscriptions I’m on the hook for and streamline the apps and services I use, I had a thought to migrate from TextExpander’s snippet expansion to Alfred. I use a fraction of what TextExpander can actually do, and Alfred’s implementation is rather good (and actually a bit faster). The thing I forgot is the fact that TextExpander’s “thing” is that they are effectively cross-platform. I don’t really need it to work on Windows, but I do use TE expansion in the few apps that support it on iOS (namely Bear and Ulysses, and exclusively on the iPad).

It will be a long, *long* time before an app like Alfred is even allowed on iOS (and hell, even TE has to partner with apps to offer the expansion, rather than it being a system-level thing). I feel like I might need to execute a U-turn...
