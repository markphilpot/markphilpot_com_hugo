I used the React TUI library [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) for the first time to build a simple TUI for cross posting these micro posts to Mastodon and Bluesky and loved the experience.  The one gap in the framework is the lack of a multi-line editor (a vim-like experience is probably too much to ask for). I might try forking to nvim as the editor (similar to how git launches `$EDITOR` for editing the commit message)
