The [news](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon) that Ubisoft is canceling the Prince of Persia - Sands of Time remake amid more layoffs just plain sucks.  I've been a huge fan of the franchise, going all the way back to the [original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)) I played on my Apple IIgs.  I have fond memories of core trilogy reboot (The Sands of Time, Warrior Within, & The Two Thrones) -- I especially loved the way they incorporated the different voice actors from the first two into the third installment.  I was looking forward to being able to play SoT on modern hardware... Ugh.
