I've taken some time over the holiday break get my last 2025 update of [anilime](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anilime/id1358133029) out to the store.  There was quite a bit of scope creep in this one:

- Expo Upgrade with a bunch of iOS 26 updates
- Moving the navigation stack to `@react-navigation`'s "native" implementations of [stack](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator) and [bottom tabs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-bottom-tab-navigator)
- A whole host of screen refactoring, mostly due to the new iOS 26 primitives, including support for the iPad's new window management

Overall, a worth while update.  I don't collect any analytics in the app and I've never bothered to dive too deeply into the store analytics that Apple provides.  I have no idea how many people still use the app -- it's mainly an app for me that I happen to share.  That being said, I do want to invest in it a bit more in 2026.  I'm not exactly sure what that will look like, but I have a few ideas.
