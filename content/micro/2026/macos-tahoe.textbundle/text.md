macOS 26 (Tahoe) was *forcibly* installed on my work laptop and I have to say… it's just not great.  I knew that would probably be my reaction, but to have it confirmed is another thing entirely. 

The menus are particularly awful — Everything looks misaligned with smatterings of poorly conceived icons.  The floating/nested sidebar concept should have been a style option for developers, not something forced upon *every, single, app.* It's a bit ironic that many apps I need for work are electron-based, and are not beholden to the design whims of Apple.

It is *very* likely that I'll keep Sequoia on my personal laptop and skip Tahoe entirely.
