Honestly, I think if Ulysses supported publishing to a micropub server I could make my POSSE system work. That realization is frustrating (I need a third party to make a change) but hopeful (it's only a single piece of a puzzle and if I can find an alternative everything would work). I think I'll give iA Writer a shot as a co-alternative (using both clients as the first step in my workflow) and see how far I can get.
