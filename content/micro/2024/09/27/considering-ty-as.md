Considering 11ty as a hugo replacement: It has the requisite performance but would require a lot of config & front matter tweaking to get something that would work (anything that needs a manual forEach ultimately doesn't make the cut). Probably not worth the effort unless I *really* wanted to rebuild it from the ground up (and at that point I might be better cutting my losses, archive the existing content, and start from scratch)
