I love POSSE as a concept and every few months I get fired up that I'm going to completely overhaul everything, only to be reminded that my main problem is I have *history* (existing posts dating back to 2003) that make things hard to do it the way I want. If I was starting from scratch today, I would consider Ghost (as long as I could identify a good mobiledoc to markdown converter for backup).

Maybe I should just freeze my legacy content and start completely fresh...
