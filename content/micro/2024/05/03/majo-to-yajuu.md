[Majo to Yajuu (The Witch and the Beast)](https://anilist.co/anime/153818/Majo-to-Yajuu/)

Interesting hint at world building, but I have a feeling this was just a teaser to get people to buy the source manga (which is apparently on hiatus, so make of that what you will). The "overlap" between episodes was too much for what was really a brief narrative.

6/10
